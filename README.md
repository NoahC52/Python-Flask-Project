# Hello! Welcome to my test project combining all my skills and projects I've learned into one central website and hub!
This project uses Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, SignalWire APIs, and OpenWeather API. Overall this is the most complicated project I've done yet,
but I'm very proud of the end result. I hope you enjoy testing it and viewing it as much as I did making it. :)

# What the various APIs are used for.
We use the SignalWire API as a general tool for the two projects hosted on the website. Those two being the weather app and the other being a 
text from browser SMS service. The OpenWeather API is used to retrieve weather data and longitude and latitude from zip codes. Both of these combined create some very
interesting applications to be used.

# Bootstrap & CSS.
At first this website just purely used CSS and was purely done with a stylesheet made entirely by me. However, this led to me dedicating almost all my time
to just CSS. I wanted to learn how to use a framework like Bootstrap for building basic websites that can host my code far faster, while still looking good. 

# .ENV file.
When you download this project, you will notice a file called "example.ENV". Please input the requested data into the slots where it asks.
This is used to store all our sensitive data that we wouldn't want just laying around in our code. After you input the data remove the "Example" part from it so it's
purely just ".ENV". We call upon our .ENV file repeatedly throughout this entire project.

# Running this website.
To run this website, open up the Python script "Boot.py" and press run! It's as simple as that. This is going to be hosted on http://127.0.0.1:5000. Enter in that URL
after you run the script and it should all boot up and work! :)

# Thank you!
Thank you for viewing and possibly testing my projects! I had a ton of fun making this and can't wait to see what I come up with for my next one!
